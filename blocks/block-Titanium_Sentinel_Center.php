$content .= "About <strong>17</strong> years ago, full-featured <strong>« website/portals »</strong> as we called them, were all the craze. <strong>PHP-Nuke</strong> 

was something easy to install on the 

many free Web Hosting accounts that were available. When it was released, It was the first CMS ever created and/or available and also came with lots of awesome 

features. 

But it had a price: unprofessional code, unstable, unmaintainable, insecure. If you want to know why security issues happened so widely, have a look at 

the old sources of <strong>PHP-Nuke</strong>, you'll know why you needed to separate html, styles, sql, php code and javascript.

At that time <strong>SQL injection</strong> and a few other security risks were a big problem : Search Engine, Contact Form, Forged Cookies, you name it. 

It was almost impossible to maintain so some 

folks got togethor and added a security layer, covering every security case you could imagine. Thus the birth of <strong>NukeSentinel</strong>...<br/><br/>
