<strong>How injections are prevented by our NukeSentinel CMS portal addon.</strong><br />
<br />
About&nbsp;<strong>17</strong>&nbsp;years ago, full-featured&nbsp;<strong>&laquo; website/portals &raquo;</strong>&nbsp;as we called them, were all the craze.&nbsp;<strong>PHP-Nuke</strong>&nbsp;was something easy to install on the many free Web Hosting accounts that were available. It was the first <strong>CMS</strong> ever created and/or available and also came with lots of awesome features. But it had a price: It had unprofessional code, it was very unstable, and almost unmaintainable, and then last but not least it was horribly insecure. If you want to know why it has some of the security holes or problems that it had, you would have to take a look under the hood, maybe explore some of the old original source code, you would see right away why someone needed to organize re-write and clean up. During the time of its production and release&nbsp;<strong>SQL injection</strong>&nbsp;and a few other security risks were a big problem: Search Engine, Contact Form, Forged Cookies, you name it. It was almost impossible to maintain so some folks got togethor and added a security layer, covering every security case you could imagine. Thus the birth of&nbsp;<strong>NukeSentinel</strong>...<br />
