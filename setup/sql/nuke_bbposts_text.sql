Containers lasting more than 100,000 years are thought possible with manufacturing conditions that minimize material defects. A titanium &quot;drip shield&quot; could also be installed over containers of other types to enhance their longevity.\n\nThe original PHP-Nuke has been around for 30+ years and we have preserved it in Titanium, PHP-Nuke Titanium to be exact...\n\nBecause titanium alloys have a highÃ‚Â tensile strength-to-density ratio, highÃ‚Â corrosion resistance, fatigue resistance, high crack resistance,Ã‚Â and the ability to withstand moderately high temperatures without creeping, they are used in aircraft, armor plating, naval ships, spacecraft, and missiles.\n\nTitanium wasÃ‚Â discoveredÃ‚Â in 1791 by theÃ‚Â clergymanÃ‚Â and amateur geologistÃ‚Â William GregorÃ‚Â as anÃ‚Â inclusionÃ‚Â of a mineral inÃ‚Â Cornwall, Great Britain. Gregor recognized the presence of a new element in ilmeniteÃ‚Â when he found black sand by a stream and noticed the sand was attracted by aÃ‚Â magnet. Analyzing the sand, he determined the presence of two metal oxides:Ã‚Â iron oxideÃ‚Â (explaining the attraction to the magnet) and 45.25% of a white metallic oxide he could not identify. Realizing that the unidentified oxide contained a metal that did not match any known element, Gregor reported his findings to theÃ‚Â Royal Geological Society of CornwallÃ‚Â and to the German science journalÃ‚Â Crell\'s Annalen.\n\nAround the same time,Ã‚Â Franz-Joseph MÃƒÂ¼ller von ReichensteinÃ‚Â produced a similar substance, but could not identify it. The oxide was independently rediscovered in 1795 byÃ‚Â PrussianÃ‚Â chemistÃ‚Â Martin Heinrich KlaprothÃ‚Â in rutile from Boinik (the German name of BajmÃƒÂ³cska), a village in Hungary (now BojniÃ„Âky in Slovakia). Klaproth found that it contained a new element and named it after theÃ‚Â TitansÃ‚Â ofÃ‚Â Greek mythology. After hearing about Gregor\'s earlier discovery, he obtained a sample of manaccanite and confirmed it to be titanium.\n\nAll of this is how we related the idea to name our Fork of PHP-Nuke, PHP-Nuke Titanium and the story relates...'),
