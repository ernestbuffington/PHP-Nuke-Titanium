*
* Ported by Nuke Cops to phpbb2 standalone 2.0.5 Test
* and debugging completed by the Elite Nukers and site members.
*
* You run this package at your sole risk. Nuke Cops and affiliates cannot
* be held liable if anything goes wrong. You are advised to test this
* package on a development system. Backup everything before implementing
* in a production environment. If something goes wrong, you can always
* backout and restore your backups.
*
* Installing and running this also means you agree to the terms of the AUP
* found at Nuke Cops.
*
* This is version 2.0.5 of the phpbb2 forum port for PHP-Nuke. Work is based
* on Tom Nitzschner's forum port version 2.0.6. Tom's 2.0.6 port was based
* on the phpbb2 standalone version 2.0.3. Our version 2.0.5 from Nuke Cops is
* now reflecting phpbb2 standalone 2.0.5 that fixes some bugs and the
* invalid_session error message.
