# Code of Conduct – The 86it Developers Network

## Purpose

[The 86it Developers Network](http://www.86it.us/)
invites anyone with a desire to talk and learn about programming and
related technologies to gather together, and share their knowledge, and help us promote The
86it Developers community.

[The 86it Developers Network](http://www.86it.us/) desires to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors as
possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming
environment for all, regardless of their professional or personal background
including education, experience, age, ability, gender, sexual orientation,
ethnicity, socioeconomic status, disability, physical appearance, or religion.
We invite all those who participate in The 86it Developers Network to help us in creating such an
environment.

This Code of Conduct (CoC) outlines the expectations of all who participate in
our network, as well as how we should respond to unacceptable behavior. We expect
participants will abide by this CoC in all community venues—whether online or
in-person—as well as in one-on-one communications as they pertain to 86it
business.

## Expectations

You are expected to:

* Behave professionally.
* Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
* Attempt collaboration before conflict.
* Refrain from any unacceptable behavior.

Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive,
discriminatory, derogatory, or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in
our group. Community event venues may be shared with members of the public;
please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

Harassment includes: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related
to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of
nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces (including presentation slides);
deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or
recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical
contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.

Our expectation is that we will treat each other, and others in our network community
who interact with us, with consideration, empathy, and respect. Our speech and behavior
will be guided by a desire to create and maintain an inclusive community purposed
towards sharing knowledge and encouraging enthusiasm for solving problems when programming.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those
with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If
a network community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers
may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban
or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in
the case of a paid event).

## Complaints

It is every community member's responsibility to notice, and attempt to intervene
or notify others, if unacceptable behaviors are occurring at a meeting or event.

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other
concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. You can
contact the organizers at contact@86it.us.

The current organizers are:

* Ernest Buffington
* Winston Terrance Wolfe
* Truman Scott Buffington
* Sebastian Scott Buffington
* Bob Marion

If you have a complaint that involves an organizer, you can contact one of the
others in confidence. The network is the priority, and steps will be taken to
ensure the network is successful.
